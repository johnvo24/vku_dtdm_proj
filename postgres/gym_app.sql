Your calves should be resting on the top of the bench and your legs should be bent at right angles.","Touch the side of your head with your fingertips (do not put your arms behind your neck!).","Lift your shoulder blades slightly off the mat to start the exercise, then crunch your abs bringing your elbows in towards your waist.","Pause for 1 second at the top, and slowly lower back down to the start position.","Keep your shoulder blades just off the mat for the entire set.","Pause for longer at the top of the movement to add extra intensity."}	{}	https://cdn.muscleandstrength.com/sites/default/files/styles/400x250/public/field/image/exercise/floorcrunchfeetonbench1.jpg?itok=P1emW6WQ	f	\N

This is the start position of the exercise.","Keeping your legs straight, feet and knees together, raise your legs up as far as possible.","Pause for a count of 1 or more, then lower back to the starting position.","Repeat for desired reps.","The longer you hold your legs up on each rep the harder the abs work.

Use the cue: “squeeze oranges in your armpits”, “put your shoulder blades in your back pockets” (i.e. scapular depression) or “imagine you’re doing a straight arm pulldown”.","The hips should be lower than the shoulders and you should be able to see the logo on the lifter’s shirt before they pull (i.e. “chest up”).

Do not let your weight shift forward onto the toes. If you find the your weight on the toes when at the bottom position of the exercise, you are performing it incorrectly.","Do not relax at the bottom of the movement. Keep your legs, back and abdominals tight as you begin the ascent.","Keep the rep timing slow and control the weight, especially when lowering. Remember the focus is on stretch and contraction!","One of the biggest mistakes people make when performing this exercise is bending over at the waist without moving the hips back. Instead of being supported by the large hamstring muscles, the weight is now placed almost entirely on the lower spine. Needless to say, this puts your back at great risk for injury. If you keep the weight close to your body your hips with naturally move back.","Technique is so important with this exercise.

Experiment (toes slightly out or neutral) to see what feels best for you.","Do NOT retract your shoulder blades. This is mechanically inefficient and a self limiting cue as it shortens the length of the arms thus requiring a larger range of motion.","Make sure you wrap your thumb around the bar and don’t utilize a false grip. Squeeze the bar as tight as possible like you’re trying to leave an imprint of your fingerprints on the bar.","Scraping the shins isn’t always necessary in the deadlift. It may occur more frequently with sumo rather than conventional work but if you have the arm pits in the correct position (as noted above) then the bar should travel vertically and the shins will become vertical and move out of the way as the knees extend.","To follow up on my previous point, if you focus on keeping the weight entirely on the heels, you won’t be able to effectively recruit your quads at the beginning of the lift and thus you’ll be slow off the flow. So, to combat this, you should focus on driving through the whole foot - you want 3 points of contact: big toe, little toe, and heel.","Ensure the elbows stay locked out. Don’t actively flex the triceps but make sure that your elbow doesn’t break neutral as this can potentially put you at risk for a bicep tear under maximal weights.","For single repetitions, it will be much easier to drop the bar from lockout (provided that it’s allowed and you’re lifting on a platform or with bumper plates) due to less eccentric loading upon your spinal erectors. However, for multiple repetitions you should try to lower the weight under control while not overly fatiguing the erectors.","If you find that you’re weak at lockout, you should incorporate rack pulls, RDLs, and/or pulls against chains or bands. On the opposite end of the spectrum however, if you’re weak off the floor, you should incorporate paused and/or deficit deadlifts.
